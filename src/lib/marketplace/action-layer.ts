/**
 * The Action Layer: one place that decides which product actions exist.
 *
 * Ten actions were listed on the Product Action Manager with a switch beside
 * each, every switch hardcoded on and none of them wired to anything. Turning
 * Buy Now off changed nothing anywhere, because each surface decided for
 * itself what to render.
 *
 * The registry lives in `system_settings` under one key rather than in new
 * tables. marketplace_action_registry, _configs, _overrides and _events all
 * answer 404 and this project has no way to run DDL today; section 43 asks for
 * new tables only where they are missing, and section 42 asks not to duplicate
 * what exists. system_settings is the platform's own configuration store, so
 * that is where this goes.
 *
 * The resolver is the point of the module. Every surface asks it the same
 * question and gets the same answer, including the reason an action is not
 * available - because an action that cannot execute should not be rendered as
 * though it can.
