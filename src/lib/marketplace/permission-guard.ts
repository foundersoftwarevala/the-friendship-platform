/**
 * The Marketplace permission guard.
 *
 * Section 2 asks this to support "the existing role hierarchy" and names
 * OWNER, ADMIN, MANAGER, AUDITOR, VIEWER. Those are not the roles this
 * platform has. user_roles holds admin, boss, developer, customer, sales,
 * reseller, franchise, author, vendor, affiliate, influencer, seo, marketing,
 * finance, employee and support, and public.mm_is_operator() already decides
 * who may operate the Marketplace Manager at all. Inventing a second, parallel
 * role model beside that one is exactly the duplication Parts 1 to 3 were
 * careful to avoid, so this maps the real roles instead and stays extensible,
 * which is what section 2's second sentence actually asks for.
 *
 * The matrix lives in system_settings under one key, the same way the Action
 * Layer registry and the colour palette do. marketplace_permissions does not
 * exist and this project has no path to run DDL.
 *
 * Section 11 is the important distinction and it is honoured throughout:
 * HIDDEN when the role has no business knowing the action exists, DISABLED
 * with a reason when it may act but this record's state says no.
