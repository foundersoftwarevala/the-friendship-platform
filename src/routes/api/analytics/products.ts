/**
 * Per-product analytics, from the events and orders that exist.
 *
 * The screen showed 128k views, 14.2k demo clicks, 3.1% conversion, 27% bounce
 * and revenue of Rs 42L, over a table whose first row was a written-in product
 * called Vala ERP Pro with 48.2k views and a trending score of 92. Section 51
 * lists those exact numbers as the thing to remove.
 *
 * What actually exists: 35 rows in marketplace_events (27 product views, 5 demo
 * clicks, 3 CTA clicks), 10 paid orders worth $2,490, 6 short-link clicks and 1
 * QR scan. Those are the numbers this returns.
 *
 * Three rules it follows rather than papering over:
 *
 *   Revenue comes from paid orders and their line items, never from a Buy
 *   click. Section 7 and section 9 both say so, and a click is intent.
 *
 *   Every rate states its own denominator. A conversion rate is meaningless
 *   without knowing what it was divided by, and mixing denominators between
 *   products makes the column a lie.
 *
 *   A metric with no events behind it returns null and says why. Bounce rate
 *   and session duration need session boundaries that these events do not
 *   carry; country and device need metadata that the historical rows have
 *   empty. Those come back as not-captured rather than as zero, because zero
 *   would read as "nobody bounced".
