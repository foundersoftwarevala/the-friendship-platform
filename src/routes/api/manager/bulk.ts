/**
 * The bulk operation engine.
 *
 * There is one table in the Marketplace Manager - LiveTable, over
 * /api/manager/resource - and forty-four sections use it. This gives that one
 * table bulk operations rather than giving each section its own, which is what
 * section 42 asks for and what section 12 means by taking actions from the
 * central registry: the operations here are exactly the ones the resource
 * whitelist already permits, evaluated per resource.
 *
 * Section 25 says the flow is validate, authorize, preview, execute, verify,
 * audit - never click then success toast. So:
 *
 *   preview: true  returns what would happen to each row and changes nothing.
 *   Every row is validated on its own, and one ineligible row does not stop
 *   the others or get quietly carried through with them.
 *   The result is per record, with a reason for each refusal.
 *   One correlation id ties every audit row of the run together.
 *
 * Partial failure is reported as partial. Section 26 is explicit that
 * successful records are not rolled back silently to make a run look clean.
