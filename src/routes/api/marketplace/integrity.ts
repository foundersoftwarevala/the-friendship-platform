/**
 * The No Fake Data Policy, measured instead of asserted.
 *
 * The screen showed six cards all reading ENFORCED and four counters all
 * reading a dash. The dashes were honest. The six ENFORCED badges were not:
 * this database contains, right now, exactly the things those six cards say
 * cannot happen.
 *
 * Fourteen products carry a rating between 4.5 and 4.9 and marketplace_reviews
 * holds no rows at all. Twelve carry download counters up to 650, with labels
 * like "650+", and marketplace_downloads holds no rows at all. Ten orders are
 * marked paid and exactly one payment intent has ever succeeded.
 *
 * So each card's status is computed from the data rather than printed. A policy
 * that says ENFORCED while its own database disagrees is worse than no policy,
 * because it is the thing people trust instead of looking.
 *
 * Nothing is corrected here. Deleting or rewriting production values to make a
 * card go green would be the same failure in the other direction; the evidence
 * is reported with the exact records, and what to do about it is the owner's
 * decision.
