/**
 * One central gate for every operator surface.
 *
 * The manager consoles were each rendering in full to anonymous visitors, and
 * there are roughly a hundred and fifty of them once the nested manager routes
 * are counted. Wrapping them one by one would leave gaps and would leave every
 * future route unprotected by default, so the decision is made here, from the
 * path, for the whole application at once.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately allow-by-default: the marketplace, product pages,
 * demos, login, applications and checkout must stay public, and the homepage is
 * a protected production route that must never be gated by accident. Only paths
 * that match a prefix below are gated.
