  Automation: AutomationConsole,
  // S.MicroFeaturesSection is the designed shell and is still exported. The
  // screen below keeps its eight cards, its labels and its surface chips, and
  // makes the switches and Save Configuration real.
  "Micro-Features": MicroInteractions,
  // S.MediaLibrarySection is the designed shell and is still exported. The
  // screen below keeps its five tabs and its four counters, and fills them
  // from real storage objects and the asset tables that exist.
  "Media Library": MediaLibrary,
  "AI Providers": S.AiProvidersSection,
  // S.ApiSection is the designed shell and is still exported. Developer API
  // stays a section of this manager - the screen below keeps its five tabs
  // and fills them from the endpoints this manager really serves.
  API: DeveloperApi,
  // S.IntegrationsSection is the designed shell and is still exported. The
  // hub below keeps its four tabs and its four counters, and checks each
  // connection instead of printing the status column.
  Integrations: IntegrationsHub,
  // S.DeploymentSection is the designed shell and is still exported. The
  // centre below keeps its eight tabs and both top actions, and reads the
  // deployment that actually happens instead of drawing providers that
  // cannot connect.
  Deployment: DeploymentCenter,
  // S.IntegritySection is the designed shell and is still exported. It
  // printed ENFORCED on all six cards; the screen below computes each
  // status from the records, which is the only way the badge can mean
  // anything.
  Integrity: IntegrityPolicy,
  // S.SecuritySection is the designed shell and is still exported - its
  // Sessions, 2FA and IP allowlist tabs have nothing behind them yet. The
  // Roles and Permissions half does, so Security opens on the connected
  // matrix the server actually enforces.
  // RoleMatrix is still the Roles tab and is rendered inside the centre
  // below rather than replaced - there is one permission matrix on this
  // platform, and a second copy would start disagreeing with the first.
  Security: SecurityCenter,
  // S.SystemSection is the designed shell and is still exported. The screen
  // below keeps its five tabs and its four counters, and computes them from
  // the telemetry this machine writes about itself every five minutes.
  System: SystemHealth,
  // S.SupportSection is the designed shell and is still exported. The desk
  // below keeps its five tabs and its four counters, over the support
  // records that already exist - and leaves CSAT as a dash, because not one
  // ticket carries a rating.
